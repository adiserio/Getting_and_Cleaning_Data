This repository includes the following files:
 1.  run_analysis.R
 2.  CodeBook.md

####**run_analysis.R**
It is an R script that cleans data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S 
smartphone and prepares a tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The input data used by the run_analysis script could be downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

run_analysis.R performs the followwing steps:
 1. Combines train and test sets to create a merged data set (DataTotal)
    * Reads train data set: X_train.txt 
    * Reads the list of all features: features.txt that corresponds to the column names of X_train.txt (X_test.txt)
    * All punctuation marks are removed from the column names 
	* Set the names for the Merged Data Set to be created
	* Reads subject_train.txt that contains the identification of the subject who performed the activity for each windows sample.
	* Reads activity labels (y_train.txt) that identifiy the activity perfomed by the subject
    * A new variables (TrainVsTest) is included to identify this set as Train Data
    * Combines subject, activity and train set (column bind)
    
	* Reads test set: X_test.txt 
	* Reads subject_test.txt that contains the identification of the subject who performed the activity for each windows sample.
    * Reads activity labels (y_test.txt) which identifiy the activity perfomed by the subject
    * Combines subject, activity and test data set (column bind)
	* Set the variable TrainVsTest to test
    * Merges train and test data sets using  a row binding  
2. Extracts only the measurement on the mean and standard deviation for each measures. Measures with meanFreq were not included
3. Asigns descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
